# MyCalculator
Windows Calculator App.  Simple and done with CLR Empty Project (.NET Framework) template in Visual Studio.

First project using more than just standard output or terminal.  Figured I'd start easy with a calculator that kind of looks like a really simple calculator.

Cannot use more than one sign (+,-,*,/)

Was having a trouble with providing input validation for the numbers to be worked with.  I tried inline if/else statements as well as exceptions but nothing seemed to work.

Works besides that.  Just wanted to get my first app up and running, regardless of how basic it is.
